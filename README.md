# TypingTest
TypingTest is a website where you can test yourself on how fast you can type in both `CPM` and `WPM`. The goal of the "game" is to type as fast as possible within a duration of **1 minute**.

The project is made with **Python** as the backend and just **Vanilla JavaScript** as the frontend handler of the typing test. Mostly this was built to test how I can make a "game" for a website without needing a lot of backend rendering, except for translation and such.

Do you feel like you're able to type fast and want to test yourself? Try today by visiting [https://typing.alexflipnote.dev](https://typing.alexflipnote.dev) and check for yourself. The test does support multiple languages as well. By simply clicking on the flag, you get redirected to a menu of multiple languages to choose from.
